# Personal-Assignment-Scheduler
A school assignment scheduler I implemented to keep track of my tasks and staying productive.

## Inspiration
I have always disliked the lack of customisation in schedule tracking apps and none of them really appealed to my style and end up being ignored. So I decided to make my own that can follow the class structures and automatic class selection features I always wanted (Feb 2022 - June 2022)
